In this section the physical background of the phenomena related to
SiPM signal generation are explained along with the algorithm used to
describe them.


SiPM
====

SiPMs are state of the art light detectors with single photon
sensitivity and photon counting capabilities.

A SiPM is composed by a dense matrix of Single Photon Avalanche Photo
Diodes (SPADs) operated in Geiger-Muller mode. The impact of a photon
on the single APD of the SiPM produces an electron - hole pair that,
due to the intense electric field, triggers an avalanche of charge
carriers that can be collected and measured.

Each single cell of the SiPM provides a binary information (hitted or
not hitted). Since all APDs are almost identical they produce the same
signal amplitude when a photon is detected, so by summing up the
signals of each cell it is possible to reconstruct the total number of
cells that have produced an avalanche. Thus the signal amplitude of
the SiPM is expected to be proportional to the number of triggered
cells and so to the number of impinging photons.
