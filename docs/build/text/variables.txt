Variables
*********

The variables needed to describe the SiPM and the simulation behavior
are global variables and are declared in the *variables.py* file.

Here is the detailed description of each variable:

size : int

   The SiPM lateral size given in millimeters. This value is used to
   calculate the total number of cells.

cellsize : int

   The pitch of a single SiPM cell in micrometers. This value is used
   to calculate the total number of cells.

After converting these two variables both in mm the total number of
cells considered in the simulation is then given by:

   N_{cell} = \left(\frac{size}{cellsize}\right)^2

Note:

  On a real SiPM the number of cells is usually a bit smaller than the
  one calculated via geometrical considerations since some area of the
  sensor is used for the electrical connections. Thou the difference
  is small and negligible.

dcr : double

   The dark count rate in kHz of the SiPM. This value must be greater
   than 0, otherwise it will throw a Division by Zero error. To turn
   off dcr use the option "-NDCR" as explained in Command line options
   . For a detailed description of dark counts generation see Dark
   Counts

xt : double

   The optical crosstalk probability expressed in the range 0-1. 0
   means no crosstalk events. For a detailed description of optical
   crosstalk generation see Optical Crosstalk

ap : double

   The afterpulsing probability expressed in the range 0-1. 0 means no
   afterpulses events. For a detailed description of afterpulses
   generation see Afterpulsing

trise : double

   The time constant of the rising edge of the signal shape in
   nanoseconds. For a detailed description of signal generation see
   Signal Shaping

tfall : double

   The time constant of the rising edge of the signal shape in
   nanoseconds.

cellrecovery : double

   The recovery time of the single SiPM cell in nanoseconds. This
   value is used to calculate the signal height in case a cell is
   hitted multiple times. A detailed description of this process can
   be found at Cell Recovery.

tauapfast : double

   The time constant in nanoseconds of the distribution of the fast
   component of afterpulses delays from their main signal.

tauapslow : double

   The time constant in nanoseconds of the distribution of the slow
   component of afterpulses delays from their main signal.

ccgv : double

   The spread of the peak height of the single cell signal. Its value
   is the \sigma of the gaussian distribution of the peak height.

SNR : double

   The signal to noise ratio of the noise generated. As signal it is
   considered the mean value of the first peak in the multi-photon
   peak spectrum and as noise it is considered the \sigma "zero peak".
   To generate the white gaussian noise this value is converted in
   sigma:

      \sigma_{noise} = \sqrt{10^{-SNR/20}}

basespread : double

   The spread of the baseline value of the signal in units of \sigma.
   This is currently set to 0 because the baseline subtraction is
   turned off too.

siglen : int

   The length in nanoseconds of the signal to generate.

sampling : double

   The sampling time intended as time granularity of the signal to
   generate. This means that two consecutive point in the signal are
   separated by a \Delta t= sampling.

   Important:

     Keep in mind that the total number of samples per signal is given
     by siglen/sampling so generating signals with many points after
     the region of interest or with too small sampling time may slow
     down a lot the computation of the signals.

intstart : double

   Starting time of the integration gate in nanoseconds. Must be
   greater than 0 and smaller than the signal length. For more details
   on signal analysis see Signal Analysis

intgate : double

   Lenght of the integration gate in nanoseconds. Must be greater than
   0 and smaller than siglen - intstart.

pregate : double

   Lenght of the pregate in nanoseconds. The pregate is placed before
   the intstart. This feature is currently being unused since the
   baseline subtraction is turned off.

fastDCR : bool

   If true enables faster generation of dark count events.

   Warning:

     This feature is still experimental. The results given by
     activating this option are acceptable but still to discuss. Use
     this feature just for debugging purposes and not for actual data
     production.

fastXT : bool

   If true enables faster generation of optical crosstalk events.

   Warning:

     This feature is still experimental. The results given by
     activating this option are acceptable but still to discuss. Use
     this feature just for debugging purposes and not for actual data
     production.
