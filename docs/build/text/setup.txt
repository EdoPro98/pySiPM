Setup
*****


External file setup
===================

The recommended way to change the parameters of the simulation or the
SiPM is to launch the simulation with the option "-f filename.txt".
The file loaded will overwrite the default options. You can decide to
overwrite all the default options or just some of them.

Note:

  The file loaded with "-f filename.txt" is read as a .py file, so
  comments must be preceded by *#* and every line will be executed as
  Python code.

Here is an example of file for a Hamamatzu SiPM S13615-1025

   size = 1
   cellsize = 25
   dcr = 100e3
   xt = 0.01
   ap = 0.03
   SNR = 30
   ccgv = 0.05

   intstart = 20
   intgate = 300
   preg = 20

   The list of editable variables can be found at … with a detailed description at …
   Configuration files for some SiPM models are present in the *files* folder and it is a good practice to put your configuration files here.


Manual setup
============

It is also possible to manually change the values in the
*variables.py* file. Keep in mind that changes in this files are
permanent.

Danger:

  Editing the *variables.py* file may change the behavior of the
  simulation in an unexpected way! Edit this file only if you know
  what you are doing.


Command line options
====================

Some command line options can be parsed to de simulation and can be
used to quickly change some parameters of the simulation.

   -H

   Shows an help message and exits. Using "-h" will display the ROOT
   help message.

   -V

   Shows the software version and exits.

   -q

   Switch to silent operation of the simulation.

   -G

   Displays each generated signal (only for debugging purposes).

   -g

   Shows histograms of integral, peak and starting time at the end of
   the simulation.

   -NDCR

   Turns off dark count events generation.

   -NXT

   Turns off the generation of optical crosstalk events.

   -NAP

   Turns off the generation of afterpulses events.

   -FDCR

   Enables faster generation of dark counts Dark Counts

   -FXT

   Enables faster generation of optical crosstalk Optical Crosstalk

   -SIG

   Enables computation of each single signal (slower)

   -j <N>

   Set the number of parallel workers to N (default is the number of
   cores detected) -d <dev> If using -SIG option this can select the
   device to use *cpu* or *gpu*

   -f <file.txt>

   Reads the configuration file selected

   -w <file.root>

   Writes the results on a rootfile.

   -W <file>

   Saves each digitized wave in a group of a hdf5 file.
