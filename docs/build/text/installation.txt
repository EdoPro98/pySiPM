Installation
************

Tip:

  At the moment pySiPM is just a collection of .py files including all
  the necessaries functions to simulate a SiPM, hence you just need to
  clone the GitHub repository and make sure that you have installed
  all the needed Python modules.


Requirments
===========


Obbligatory
-----------

* **Python**: pySiPM is created using Python3.6 but it should also
  work with newer versions of Python.

     * numpy

     * matplotlib

     * uproot

     * h5py

* **Cern ROOT**: Version 6.19 and newer. It has been tested on ROOT
  versions 6.19 - 6.20 and 6.20.2. At the moment ROOT is only used for
  visualization but in future versions it will be used for I/O
  operations. Download ROOT

* **Fortran**: f2py is used to wrap fortran code. f2py is installed by
  default when installing Numpy.


Optional
--------

* **Cupy**: Cupy is used to take advantage of Nvidia GPUs computing
  power. It requires CUDA to be installed in the system. Download CUDA


Linux How To
============

   When installing ROOT make sure to link it with Python3: "-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=\usr\bin\python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=\usr\include\python3.6\Python.h"
   If Cern ROOT is not installed it is better to install it **after** Nvidia CUDA, so it can find CUDA libraries and build upon them using "-Dcuda=ON"

To install Python packages needed:

   python3 -m pip install numpy matplotlib uproot

To install CUDA (Nvidia Gpu needed) and Cupy (code example for Ubuntu
18.04):

   wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run
   sudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run

To set environment variables in .bashrc add:

   export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda-10.2
   export PATH=$CUDADIR/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDADIR/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDADIR/extras/CUPTI/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

Then Cupy can be installed via pip:

   python3 -m pip install cupy

Compilation of shared libraries
===============================

   Fortran libraries have to be compiled using f2py. A Makefile.py automatizes the procedure.
   Before running the simulation make sure to compile the libraries by running:

   python3 Makefile.py

Shared libraries can be eventually compiled manually by using:

f2py3.6 -c –opts = ‘-Ofast -funroll-all-loops -ffast-math
-march=native -pipe’ -m FortranFunctions FortranFunctions.f90
