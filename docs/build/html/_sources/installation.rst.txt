Installation
============

.. Tip::
    At the moment pySiPM is just a collection of .py files including all the necessaries functions to simulate a SiPM, hence you just need to clone the GitHub repository and make sure that you have installed all the needed Python modules.

Requirments
------------

Obbligatory
***********

* **Python**: pySiPM is created using Python3.6 but it should also work with newer versions of Python.

    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * uproot
    * h5py

* **Cern ROOT**: Version 6.19 and newer. It has been tested on ROOT versions 6.19 - 6.20 and 6.20.2. At the moment ROOT is only used for visualization but in future versions it will be used for I/O operations. `Download ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root>`_
* **Fortran**: f2py is used to wrap fortran code. f2py is installed by default when installing Numpy.

Optional
********
* **Cupy**: Cupy is used to take advantage of Nvidia GPUs computing power. It requires CUDA to be installed in the system. `Download CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_

Linux How To
------------
| When installing ROOT make sure to link it with Python3: :code:`-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=\usr\bin\python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=\usr\include\python3.6\Python.h`
| If Cern ROOT is not installed it is better to install it **after** Nvidia CUDA, so it can find CUDA libraries and build upon them using :code:`-Dcuda=ON`

To install Python packages needed:

.. code-block:: sh

  python3 -m pip install numpy matplotlib uproot

To install CUDA (Nvidia Gpu needed) and Cupy (code example for Ubuntu 18.04):

.. code-block:: sh

  wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run
  sudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run

To set environment variables in .bashrc add:

.. code-block:: sh

  export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda-10.2
  export PATH=$CUDADIR/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDADIR/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDADIR/extras/CUPTI/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

Then Cupy can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: sh

  python3 -m pip install cupy

For further help on CUDA installation check Nvidia installation guide: `CUDA installation guide <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#runfile>`_

To download CUDA for other architectures: `Download CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_

Compilation of shared libraries
--------------------------------

| Fortran libraries have to be compiled using f2py. A Makefile.py automatizes the procedure.
| Before running the simulation make sure to compile the libraries by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 Makefile.py

Shared libraries can be eventually compiled manually by using:

.. code-block:: bash

  f2py3.6 -c --opts = '-Ofast -march=native -mavx2' -m FortranFunctions FortranFunctions.f90
